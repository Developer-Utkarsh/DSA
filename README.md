# Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Repository 🚀

Welcome to my DSA learning journey! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for learning, practicing, and revising Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Repository Structure 📂

```
dsa/
├── cpp/              # C++ implementations and practice
├── leetcode/         # LeetCode solutions and notes
├── concepts/         # DSA concepts and explanations
└── practice/         # Additional practice problems
```

## How to Use This Repository 📚

### 1. Learning Path
- Start with basics in the language-specific folder (e.g., `cpp/`)
- Move to fundamental DSA concepts in `concepts/`
- Practice with problems in `practice/` and `leetcode/`

### 2. For Each Topic
- Read concept notes
- Study implementations
- Solve related problems
- Review solutions
- Make revision notes

### 3. LeetCode Integration
Each problem in the leetcode directory includes:
- Problem link
- Difficulty level
- Topic tags
- Solution with detailed explanation
- Time & Space complexity
- Key learning points
- Related problems

### 4. Practice System
1. **Daily Practice**
   - Solve at least 1-2 new problems
   - Revise 2-3 previously solved problems
   - Document learnings

2. **Topic-wise Practice**
   - Focus on one topic at a time
   - Complete all problems in that topic
   - Make topic-specific notes

3. **Revision Strategy**
   - Weekly revision of concepts
   - Monthly revision of hard problems
   - Maintain a revision log

## File Naming Convention 📝

### For LeetCode Problems
```
leetcode/[difficulty]/[problem-number]-[problem-name]/
├── README.md        # Problem description & approach
├── solution.cpp     # Solution implementation
└── notes.md         # Personal notes & learnings
```

### For Concept Learning
```
concepts/[topic-name]/
├── README.md        # Concept explanation
├── implementation/  # Code implementations
└── problems/        # Related practice problems
```
