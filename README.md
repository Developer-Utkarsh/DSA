# Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Repository 🚀

Welcome to my DSA learning journey! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for learning, practicing, and revising Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Repository Structure 📂

```
dsa/
├── cpp/              # C++ implementations and practice
├── leetcode/         # LeetCode solutions and notes
├── concepts/         # DSA concepts and explanations
└── practice/         # Additional practice problems
```

## Solution Documentation Structure 📝

Each problem solution should include:

### 1. Problem Documentation (`problem.md`)
```markdown
# Problem Name

## Description
[Problem description]

## Constraints
- Time Limit: O(?)
- Space Limit: O(?)
- Input Constraints

## Examples
[Input/Output examples]
```

### 2. Visual Documentation (`diagrams/`)
- Use `.drawio` files for diagrams (VS Code Draw.io Integration)
- Include both source `.drawio` and exported `.png` files
- Naming convention: `approach1-flow.drawio`, `memory-layout.drawio`

### 3. Pseudocode (`pseudocode.md`)
```markdown
# Approach 1: [Name]

## High-level Idea
[Brief explanation]

## Pseudocode
```algorithm
function solve(input):
    // Step 1: Initialize
    ...
    // Step 2: Process
    ...
    // Step 3: Return result
    return result
```

### 4. Implementation (`solution.cpp`)
```cpp
/**
 * Solution for: [Problem Name]
 * Approach: [Approach Name]
 * 
 * Time: O(?)
 * Space: O(?)
 */
class Solution {
    // Implementation
};
```

## Example Problem Structure
```
problem-name/
├── problem.md           # Problem description
├── diagrams/
│   ├── approach1.drawio # Draw.io source file
│   └── approach1.png    # Exported diagram
├── pseudocode.md        # Algorithm steps
├── solution.cpp         # Implementation
└── README.md           # Solution explanation
```

## Setting Up VS Code for Diagrams 🎨

1. Install Draw.io Integration:
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Draw.io Integration"
   - Install the extension

2. Creating Diagrams:
   - Create a new file with `.drawio` extension
   - VS Code will open the Draw.io editor
   - Create your diagram
   - Export as PNG if needed

3. Recommended Diagram Types:
   - Flow diagrams
   - Memory layouts
   - Tree/Graph visualizations
   - State transitions
   - Algorithm steps

## Best Practices for Documentation 📚

1. **Problem Analysis**
   - Break down the problem
   - List edge cases
   - Draw initial examples

2. **Visual Documentation**
   - Use consistent colors/shapes
   - Label important components
   - Show step-by-step flow

3. **Pseudocode**
   - Use clear naming
   - Include comments
   - Show complexity analysis

4. **Implementation**
   - Match pseudocode structure
   - Add detailed comments
   - Include test cases
