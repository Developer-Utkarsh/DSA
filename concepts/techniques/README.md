# Problem-Solving Techniques in C++ ðŸ’¡

This directory contains common problem-solving techniques and patterns implemented in C++.

## Structure

```
techniques/
â”œâ”€â”€ two-pointers/   # Two pointer approach
â”œâ”€â”€ sliding-window/ # Sliding window pattern
â”œâ”€â”€ binary-search/  # Binary search variations
â””â”€â”€ backtracking/   # Backtracking problems
```

## Implementation Template

```cpp
/**
 * Technique implementation template
 */
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @brief Problem solution using specific technique
     * 
     * @param params Input parameters
     * @return Result
     * 
     * Technique: [Name]
     * Time: O(?)
     * Space: O(?)
     */
    ReturnType solveProblem(Parameters...) {
        // Implementation
    }
    
private:
    // Helper methods
};
```

## Documentation Format

Each technique should include:
1. Explanation of the technique
2. When to use it
3. Common patterns
4. Example problems
5. Implementation tips

## Best Practices
1. Start with brute force
2. Optimize step by step
3. Document thought process
4. Include multiple variations
5. Compare with other approaches
